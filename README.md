# Reversi-Love2D-CS-with-Alpha-Beta-Pruning
Made as part of university project, Reversi with Alpha-Beta pruning based AI. Heuristic function uses risk zones from [this website](http://mnemstudio.org/game-reversi-example-2.htm), but I don't think it's perfect in it's current form, becuase I used pretty brute way of evaluating.  
Also example of how Love2dCS looks like, this time code is better than in my [2048](https://github.com/KonstantinRight/2048-Love2dCS).
