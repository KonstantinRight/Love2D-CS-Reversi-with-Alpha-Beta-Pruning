# Reversi-Love2D-CS-with-Alpha-Beta-Pruning
Made as part of university project, Reversi with Alpha-Beta pruning based AI. Heuristic function uses risk zones from [this website](http://mnemstudio.org/game-reversi-example-2.htm), but I don't think the function is perfect in it's current state, becuase I used pretty brute way of evaluating.  
Written in Love2D (using C# Wrapper Love2dCS).
